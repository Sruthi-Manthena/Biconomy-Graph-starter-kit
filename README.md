# Biconomy-Graph-starter-kit

## Overview

Welcome to the Biconomy Graph Integration Starter Kit! This README provides a guide to help developers build their own Subgraph and integrate it with Biconomy. By following the instructions in this repository, you will be able to quickly set up a Subgraph and leverage Biconomy's powerful features for seamless transaction processing and gasless transactions.

## Getting Started

To begin, navigate to the "bic" folder in this repository. Here, you'll find a template and the necessary components to start building your Subgraph.

## Building Your Subgraph

Follow these steps to build your Subgraph and integrate it with Biconomy:

1. Clone this repository: Start by cloning this starter kit repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the "bic" folder: Enter the "bic" folder to access the template and components for Biconomy integration.

3. Set up your Subgraph: Use the template provided to set up your Subgraph. Customize it according to your project's needs and data sources. You can build your own subgraph or use existing subgraphs from the Subgraph Studio

4. Integrate with Biconomy's smart contract addresses. (as mentioned in the bic template)

6. Deploy your Subgraph: Once you're satisfied with the functionality and testing, deploy your Subgraph and Biconomy-integrated smart contracts.

## Resources

For additional information and resources, refer to the following:

- [Biconomy Documentation](https://docs.biconomy.io/): Detailed documentation on Biconomy's features and integration guides.

- [The Graph Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/): Comprehensive documentation on The Graph protocol.

Happy building!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Start off with `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
